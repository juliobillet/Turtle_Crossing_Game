# Turtle_Crossing_Game

Turtle Crossing Game made in python, with the help of the Turtle module.

This is a study project from the course #100DaysWithPython by Angela Yu.

As I'm learning, if you see something that could be improved in the code, or be done in a differently and easier way, please point it out! I would appreciate it a lot!
